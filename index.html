<h2>Incremental Decision Tree Induction</h2>

<p>ITI (Incremental Tree Inducer) is a program that constructs <a
href="dtree-background.html">decision trees</a> automatically from
labeled examples.  Although the program is called ITI, it includes
both the ITI and DMTI (Direct Metric Tree Induction> algorithms.  
One runs the ITI program, but with certain command options invokes the 
DMTI algorithm within.
</p>

<p>
The most useful aspect of the ITI algorithm is that is provides a
mechanism for incremental tree induction.  If one has already
constructed a tree, and then obtains a new labeled example, it is
possible to present it the algorithm, and have the algorithm revise
the tree as necessary.  The alternative would be to build a new tree
from scratch, based on the now augmented set of labeled examples,
which is typically much more expensive.  ITI handles symbolic and
numeric variables, and missing data values.  It includes a virtual
pruning mechanism too.
</p>

<p>
ITI is implemented in ANSI C, and it has been actively maintained
since 1994.  Version 3.10 (23 March 2001) is current.  The code
distribution includes several other programs, including a tree drawing
program PST that generates PostScript code.  An <a
href="ftp://ftp.cs.umass.edu/pub/iti/iti.ps">article</a> about ITI and
DMTI appears in October 1997 Machine Learning journal.

<p> The <a href="license.html">source code</a> is protected by
copyright, but is available for individual research purposes.  If you
wish to use this code in any other way, you must sign a licensing
agreement covering your intended activity.  This is quite easy to do -
send me email for more info.  </p>

<p>
The documentation now lives on these Web pages, and is therefore no
longer included in the distribution.  It is quite easy to <a
href="iti-how-to-install.html">install</a> the code.  There is a <a
href="iti-change-log.html">log of changes</a> from each version to the
next, directions for <a href="iti-how-to-run.html">running ITI and
DMTI</a>, and similar directions for <a
href="pst-how-to-run.html">running PST</a>.
